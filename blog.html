            <div class="first-question">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold"> Question 1: What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM ?</h2>
                <h5 class="text-base mt-2 font-semibold"><span class="font-bold">Answer :</span> The Document Object Model (DOM) this is the full meaning of DOM and it is a programming interface for HTML. It translates the content of an HTML document into a standardized object that functional programming languages like JavaScript can easily access and modify. All dynamic web pages depend on the DOM to display and function properly.</h5>
                <h5 class="text-base mt-5 font-semibold">Tha main purposes of DOM are, In web design, JavaScript is used to control the behavior of web pages. The DOM links JavaScript to the source HTML code, which enables JavaScript to execute its functions on individual HTML elements. This JavaScript-HTML interaction creates the experience of interactive web design.</h5>

        <!-- Second Question -->
        <div class="container flex justify-between bg-base-100 shadow-2xl px-10 md:px-20 mt-5 w-full py-4 mx-auto rounded-xl bg-cyan-100">
            <div class="first-question">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold"> Question 2: How will you select HTML element using DOM ? Name of all DOM methods</h2>
                <h5 class="text-base mt-2 font-semibold"><span class="font-bold">Answer :</span> Normally we can select HTML tag by using class or unique id. If we use class than we have to run a for loop accessing data, otherwise if we use unique id for accessing data we can easily select the particular element</h5>
                <h5 class="text-base mt-5 font-semibold">There are several DOM selector methods available in JavaScript, each with a different use case. Some of the most commonly used methods are:

                   <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
                   <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
                   <li>getElementById()</li>
                   <li>querySelector()</li>
                   <li>querySelectorAll()</li></h5>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Third Question  -->
        <div class="container flex justify-between bg-base-100 shadow-2xl px-10 md:px-20 mt-5 w-full py-4 mx-auto rounded-xl bg-cyan-100">
            <div class="third-question">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold"> Question 3: What is event bubble?</h2>
                <h5 class="text-base mt-2 font-semibold"><span class="font-bold">Answer :</span> Event bubbling is a way of event propagation in the HTML DOM. It relates to the order in which events are propagated in nested elements.
                    <br>In bubbling, when an event happens, the handler of the innermost element runs, then the parents, and then the further ancestor elements. In other words, events bubble up or propagate the DOM tree upwards.</h5>

        <!-- Fourth Question  -->
        <div class="container flex justify-between bg-base-100 shadow-2xl px-10 md:px-20 mt-5 w-full py-4 mx-auto rounded-xl bg-cyan-100">
            <div class="fourth-question">
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold"> Question 4: What is a Callback Function and why will you use it?</h2>
                <h5 class="text-base mt-2 font-semibold"><span class="font-bold">Answer :</span> A callback function in javascript is a function that is passed as an argument in another function. Which is then called inside the parent function to complete a routine or an action. To put it more simply, it is a function that will be executed later after its parent function is done executing.
                    <br>Javascript is a single-threaded language, which means, it executes the code sequentially one line after another. However, there are some cases in which a part of the code will only run after some lines of code, i.e. it is dependent on another function. This is called asynchronous programming.

                    <li>We need callback functions to make sure that a function is only going to get executed after a specific task is completed and not before its completion.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Callback functions are also needed to prevent running into errors because of the non-availability of some data that are needed by some other function.</li>
